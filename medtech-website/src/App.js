// Each page is rendered by a different function and routing by React Router
// This eliminates the need for multiple .js files for simple pages
// Routing is at the bottom under App(); new links must be added to the routing for a direct URL to work
// Such as inputting /about manually into the URL bar
// For new pages that have buttons in the NavBar, must also add the routers in the NavBar component
